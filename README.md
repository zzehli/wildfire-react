This is project is uses NASA Earth Observatory Natural Event Tracker api to fetch weather data and place them onto Google Map with `google-map-react` package. This project is an extension of the tutorial by Brad Traversy.

## Demo
![Alt Text](demo.gif)

## Features
* Visualise current wildfire around the world
* Display detailed location infomation if available
* Toggle away info-box by clicking again

## Toggle Weather Events
* Problem: should cache the API request and filter according to my criteria in order to make this function work. A demo without API call is [here](https://github.com/google-map-react/google-map-react/issues/993#issue-788674608).

* Add new Feature : toggle different weather with float button using `useState()` hook

[Watch!](https://youtu.be/OcF3CsZ7vYE) a demo of this feature.
